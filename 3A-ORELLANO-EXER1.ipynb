        "\n",
        "Expert systems are a prominent example of AI systems that utilize logic-based reasoning to assist in decision-making processes. These systems are designed to emulate the decision-making abilities of human experts in specific domains, such as medical diagnosis, financial analysis, and technical support. They consist of a knowledge base, which contains domain-specific information, and an inference engine that applies logical rules to derive conclusions from the knowledge base.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Application of Propositional and Predicate Logic**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Propositional Logic:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Expert systems often employ propositional logic to represent facts and rules in a structured manner. For instance, a medical diagnosis expert system might use rules like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a patient has a fever (F) and a cough (C), then they may have the flu (FL):\n",
        "$$ (F \\land C) \\rightarrow FL $$\n",
        "This representation allows the system to deduce potential diagnoses based on the symptoms presented by the patient.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Predicate Logic:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Predicate logic extends propositional logic by allowing for more complex statements involving quantifiers and variables. For example, an expert system might represent knowledge about patients as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- For all patients (P), if they have a certain symptom (S), then they may require a specific treatment (T):\n",
        "$$ \\forall P (S(P) \\rightarrow T(P)) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "This enables the system to make inferences about individual patients based on general rules, enhancing its reasoning capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Advantages and Challenges of Logic-Based Models**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Advantages:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Consistency and Dependability:** Models based on logic ensure consistent decision-making processes by relying on well-defined rules, guaranteeing that the same input will produce the same output. This is especially important in fields like healthcare where decisions can have a significant impact on outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Representation of Knowledge:** These systems can capture extensive expert knowledge in a structured format, making it accessible even in the absence of human experts. This is particularly advantageous in situations where expert availability is limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficient Decision-Making:** Expert systems can analyze information and reach conclusions more quickly than human experts, leading to improved response times in critical situations, such as medical emergencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenges:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Common sense reasoning is often lacking in logic-based systems, causing them to struggle in scenarios requiring intuitive judgment. These systems rely solely on the rules encoded in their knowledge bases, which can lead to incorrect conclusions in ambiguous situations.\n",
        "- Maintaining and updating the knowledge base poses a significant challenge as new information becomes available. Expert systems require regular updates to their rules and facts, which can be resource-intensive.\n",
        "- Expert systems are typically designed for specific domains and may not perform well outside their area of expertise. This limits their applicability in broader contexts where interdisciplinary knowledge is required.\n",
        "- The accuracy of an expert system's output heavily depends on the quality and completeness of the data it receives. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to erroneous conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "To sum up, although expert systems and other logic-based models have clear benefits in handling structured decision-making and representing knowledge, they encounter difficulties in areas such as adaptability, common-sense reasoning, and reliance on data. As AI advances, it will be crucial to tackle these challenges in order to improve the efficiency and usefulness of logic-based systems in practical situations."

        "This Python script effectively models a voting eligibility system using logic-based rules. It allows for user input to determine if a voter is eligible to vote and provides detailed feedback on their status. This approach can be further expanded to include more complex scenarios and additional logic rules as needed."
